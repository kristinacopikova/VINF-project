Mambila people;	"";	"";	"gembu, nigeria}} in [[taraba state]] of nigeria [note that the traditional and historical name of this local government area has been \"mambilla\", and that the \"sardauna\" misnomer is a modern imposition by external or non-indigenous peoples, particularly, in conjunction with the defunct jega government of 1984].  this is a highland plateau, the northerly continuation of the [[bamenda]] grassfields.  the plateau is dissected by many rivers (notably the river donga) leaving a complex geography of steep valleys separated by highlands (all of similar altitude). the gang peak, located in the northeastern corner of the mambilla plateau, on the mambilla-gashaka-cameroon tri-point boundary zone, is nigeria's loftiest landform. villages are found both on the hilltops and on valley bottoms, and are relatively isolated from one another particularly during the rainy seasons when river crossings can be difficult (and impossible for motorised transport). agriculture is concentrated on the valley bottoms while the highlands have been extensively grazed since the 1940s, i.e. since the immigration of cattle graziers towards the end of british administration (it was part of british cameroon until the referendum of 1959/61).  there has been overgrazing and erosion has caused considerable problems from the late 1970s onwards."
